This is a terminal website heavily inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtYby2QN0kQ.

Ty for the idea for a minimalist website. I cleaned up the easter egg part and renamed some things for cleaner code. 

There are still some improvements to be made for a t1 look and feel :)
 - Commands get written on few pixels off when pressing enter
 - remove unneeded CSS rules
 - somehow enable tab completion
   - this might be very tricky

Things I improved
 - Added a onclick window hook so that cursor stays in the text box
 - VSCode colors
